# Image-classification
This repository contains the code and resources for training and evaluating an image classification model.
Key Features:
Model Training: Implemented a data generator for efficient training over 10 epochs, ensuring balanced learning and validation.
Model Evaluation: Performed thorough evaluation using a test set, generating predictions, and assessing accuracy.
Confusion Matrix: Visualized the model's performance across different classes with a confusion matrix, providing insights into classification accuracy.
Classification Report: Generated a detailed classification report including precision, recall, and F1-score for each class, highlighting model performance.
Accuracy and Loss Visualization: Tracked the model's learning progress through accuracy and loss plots over the epochs, aiding in model tuning.
Confusion Matrix Heatmap: Created a heatmap for the confusion matrix to enhance visualization of prediction errors.
Model Summary: Provided a comprehensive summary of the model's architecture, detailing its structure and complexity.
Sample Image Display: Showcased the model's predictions with sample images from the test set and their predicted classes.
Model Saving: Saved the trained model for future use and potential deployment.
This project showcases my ability to build, train, evaluate, and save deep learning models for image classification tasks. The skills learned here will be applied to future projects as I continue my journey in AI and Machine Learning.
